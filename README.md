# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

Make sure you also run the API https://github.com/JayGadi/preqin-technical-test

Extra Notes:
I am not sure if the investor_id is the same with the firm_id as I always get 404 response when I make a call to: /api/investor/commitment/{asset_class}/{investor_id}
